CLASS NOTES – JavaScript Data Types (Complete Summary)
From the Latest Class – Super Important for Interviews & Clarity

1. Memory Recap (Never Forget This)
   - Hard Disk → Secondary Memory (slow, permanent)
   - RAM       → Primary Memory (fast, temporary)
   - Any program that runs (Chrome, VS Code, JavaScript) → lives inside RAM only
   - When JavaScript runs → it automatically creates 2 partitions inside RAM:
        1. Stack Memory  → for primitive data types
        2. Heap Memory   → for non-primitive (objects, arrays – later)

   From today, every program will be explained using Stack & Heap.

2. How to Store Data in JavaScript (Variables)
   Syntax:
   let variableName = value;    // semicolon is must

   Example:
   let age = 23;
   → Inside Stack: one small box is created → name = age → value = 23

   To print:
   console.log(age);            // 23
   console.log(typeof age);     // "number"

3. JavaScript is Loosely Typed (Dynamically Typed)
   - You DO NOT write the type (unlike Java/C++)
   - JavaScript itself decides the type based on the value you store
   - Same variable can hold integer, decimal, string etc.

   Java/C++ → Strongly Typed (you must write int, float, etc.)

4. All 7 Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

   1. number
      - Used for BOTH integers and decimals (floating-point)
      - Examples: 23, -50, 68.2, 5.9
      - Special values that are also "number":
         ∞     → Infinity
         -∞    → -Infinity
         NaN   → Not a Number (e.g., "hello"/2)
      - Range: -(2⁵³ - 1) to (2⁵³ - 1)   ≈  ± 9,007,199,254,740,991
      - If you cross this range → wrong value is stored

   2. bigint
      - For extremely large integers (beyond number range)
      - How to create: add suffix n
        let huge = 1234567890123456789012345n;
      - Rules:
         • Only for whole numbers (no decimal → 100.5n is invalid)
         • Arithmetic allowed only between two bigints (bigint + number → error)
         • Type → "bigint"

   3. string
      - Series of characters
      - Written inside " " or ' ' or ` `
      - Example:
        let name = "Tap Academy";
        typeof name → "string"

   4. boolean
      - Only two values: true or false
      - Example:
        let hasPassport = true;
        let isPlaced    = false;
        typeof hasPassport → "boolean"

   5. undefined
      - When you create a variable but don't assign any value
      - Example:
        let x;
        console.log(x);        // undefined
        console.log(typeof x); // "undefined"
      - Value and type both are undefined

   6. null
      - Intentional absence of value (means "empty" or "nothing")
      - We will learn in detail during Objects topic
      - typeof null → "object" (historical bug in JS)

   7. symbol (advanced – later)

5. Quick Summary Table

   Data Type     | Example Value               | typeof result   | Notes
   --------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------
   number        | 23, 5.9, Infinity, NaN      | "number"        | Integer + decimal
   bigint        | 12345678901234567890n       | "bigint"        | For super large integers
   string        | "Tap Academy", 'Rohit'      | "string"        |
   boolean       | true, false                 | "boolean"       |
   undefined     | let x; → x                  | "undefined"     | No value given
   null          | null                        | "object"        | Empty by intention
   symbol        | Symbol("id")                | "symbol"        | Unique identifiers

6. Important typeof Examples
   typeof 50              → "number"
   typeof 50.5            → "number"
   typeof "hello"         → "string"
   typeof true            → "boolean"
   typeof undefined       → "undefined"
   typeof null            → "object"   (famous JS bug)
   typeof 1234567890n     → "bigint"

7. Key Takeaways (Must Remember Forever)
   - JavaScript has only 7 primitive data types
   - number covers both int and float
   - Use bigint only when you need numbers bigger than ~9 quadrillion
   - Variables are created using let (or const/var – later)
   - JavaScript decides type automatically → Loosely Typed
   - Stack memory stores all primitive values
