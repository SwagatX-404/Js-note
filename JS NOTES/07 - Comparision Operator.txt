COMPARISON OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT

Two main equality operators:
1. ==   → Loose Equality (Double Equals)   → Checks VALUE only (does type conversion)
2. ===  → Strict Equality (Triple Equals) → Checks VALUE + TYPE both (no conversion)

Rule of thumb (ALWAYS USE IN PROJECTS & INTERVIEWS):
→ Use === (strict equality) 99% of the time
→ Only use == if you exactly know why you need loose comparison

How == (loose equality) works → It does IMPLICIT TYPE CONVERSION (Type Coercion)

Important Conversion Rules JavaScript Follows Internally (for ==)

1. When comparing Number and String
   → String is converted to Number
   Example:
   5 == "5"          → true      (because "5" → 5)
   5 === "5"         → false     (types different)

2. When comparing Boolean and Number
   → Boolean is converted to Number
   true  → 1
   false → 0
   Example:
   true == 1         → true
   true === 1        → false

3. When comparing Boolean and String
   → First: String → Number
   → Then:  Boolean → Number
   Example:
   true == "1"       → true      ("1" → 1, true → 1 → 1 == 1)
   true === "1"      → false

4. Special Cases (Very Important for Interviews)

   null and undefined
   null == undefined      → true
   null === undefined     → false

   Empty string and 0
   "" == 0                → true      ("" → 0)
   "" === 0               → false

   false and empty string
   false == ""            → true      (both become 0)
   false === ""           → false

   null and false
   null == false          → false     (null is not converted to 0 here)
   null === false         → false

   undefined and 0
   undefined == 0         → false
   undefined === 0        → false

   NaN with anything (even itself)
   NaN == NaN             → false     (only value in JS not equal to itself!)

   String numbers with leading zeros
   "001" == 1             → true      ("001" → 1)
   "010" == 10            → true      ("010" → 10)

   0 and null
   0 == null              → false

Summary Table (Most Asked in Interviews)

Expression         |  == (loose)  |  === (strict)  |  Reason
-------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------
5 == "5"           | true         | false          | string → number
true == 1          | true         | false          | true → 1
true == "1"        | true         | false          | "1" → 1, true → 1
null == undefined  | true         | false          | special rule
"" == 0            | true         | false          | "" → 0
false == ""        | true         | false          | both → 0
false == 0         | true         | false          | false → 0
null == false      | false        | false          | no conversion
NaN == NaN         | false        | false          | NaN is never equal
"  " == 0          | false        | false          | space string ≠ 0 ("  " → 0 only if trimmed? No, actually "  " → 0 too! Wait:

Wait → " " (string with space) == 0 → true in loose!
   " " == 0           → true       (whitespace string → 0)
   " " === 0          → false

Final List of FALSY values (all become false/0 in loose comparison)
→ false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN

Best Practice (Write this in your code forever):
Always use === and !==
Never use == and != (unless you have a very specific reason)

Quick Tip to Remember:
If you see == in code → think "type conversion happening"
If you see === → think "safe, no surprises"
