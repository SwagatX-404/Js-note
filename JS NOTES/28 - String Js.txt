          JAVA SCRIPT - STRINGS - DETAILED NOTES
          (From Namaste JavaScript Style - In-Depth)
==================================================================

1. Why Strings Are Important
   - Strings and Arrays = Most frequently asked topics in coding interviews
   - 9 out of 10 questions in JS interviews revolve around Strings & Arrays
   - Mastering strings is absolutely crucial

2. What is a String?
   - A string is a sequence of characters
   - Even a single character ('A', "J") is considered a string in JavaScript
   - Examples:
       'J'          → string
       "JavaScript" → string
       "Tap Academy"→ string

3. 3 Ways to Create Strings in JavaScript

   Method 1: Using Double Quotes (Most Common)
       let s1 = "JavaScript";

   Method 2: Using Single Quotes
       let s2 = 'Rohit';

   Method 3: Using Backticks (Template Literals / Template Strings)
       let name = "Rohit";
       let greeting = `Hi, ${name}`;  // Output: Hi, Rohit
       // Syntax: ${variable} inside backticks
       // Allows embedding variables/expressions directly

   Summary:
       " "  → Regular string
       ' '  → Regular string
       ` `  → Template literal (supports interpolation & multi-line)

4. Strings in Memory - How JavaScript Stores Strings

   Key Concepts:
   - All strings are stored in the HEAP memory
   - Inside Heap → There is a special area called STRING POOL
   - JavaScript uses STRING INTERNING

   What is String Interning?
       - For the same string value, only ONE unique copy exists in memory
       - Multiple variables can refer to the same string object in the string pool
       - Saves memory + makes comparison faster

   Example:
       let s1 = "JavaScript";
       let s2 = "JavaScript";
       // Both s1 and s2 point to the SAME object in string pool
       // Address: say 1000 for both → s1 === s2 → true

   Case Sensitivity Matters!
       let a = "Java";
       let b = "java";
       // These are DIFFERENT → two separate objects created
       // Because JavaScript is case-sensitive

5. Special Case: Using new String()

       let s3 = new String("JavaScript");

   Important Differences:
       typeof s1     → "string"      (primitive)
       typeof s2     → "string"      (primitive)
       typeof s3     → "object"      ← This creates a String OBJECT (not primitive)

   Comparison Behavior:
       s1 == s3   → true   (loose equality → compares value)
       s1 === s3  → false  (strict equality → value + type must match)

   Note:
       Always prefer "JavaScript" or 'JavaScript' or `JavaScript`
       Avoid new String() unless you have a specific reason

6. Strings Are Immutable in JavaScript

   Meaning:
       Once a string is created, it CANNOT be changed
       You can read individual characters
       cannot modify them

   Example:
       let str = "JavaScript";
       console.log(str[2]);     // "v" → readable
       str[2] = "V";            // Try to change → NO EFFECT
       console.log(str);        // Still "JavaScript"

   Why Immutable?
       - Because of String Interning
       - If one variable changes the string, others referring to same memory would also change → bug-prone
       - So JS made strings immutable by design
       - No error is thrown → silent failure (important for interviews!)

   Key Point:
       You CAN access characters: str[4], str.charAt(4)
       You CANNOT modify: str[4] = 'x' → does nothing

Summary Table

Feature                     Double/Single Quotes       Backticks (`)         new String()
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Type                        primitive string          primitive string      String object
Template Interpolation      Not supported             Supported (${})       Not directly
Strict Equality (===)       Same as other primitives  Same                  Different (object)
Memory (String Pool)        Yes                       Yes                   Wrapper object
Recommended?                YES                       YES (when needed)     Avoid

==================================================================
Key Takeaways for Interviews

1. Strings are immutable → cannot change individual characters
2. String interning → same literal = same memory reference
3. "hello" === "hello" → true
4. "hello" === new String("hello") → false (type mismatch)
5. Use backticks for template strings with variables
6. Never use new String() in real code
7. Case-sensitive → "Cat" ≠ "cat"

==================================================================
That's it! You now have a rock-solid foundation on JavaScript Strings.
Master this → crush 90% of string-related interview questions!

Happy Coding!
