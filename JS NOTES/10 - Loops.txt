CLASS NOTES – LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT (The Real Power of Programming)
Topic: for, while, do-while Loops + Pattern Programming Foundation

1. Why Loops Are MUST-KNOW
   - Repeat a task 5 times, 100 times, 10,000 times → without copy-paste
   - Used everywhere in real projects:
        • Array/Object traversal
        • DOM manipulation
        • Event handling
        • Animations
        • Data processing
        • Pattern programming (interview favorite)

2. The Problem Without Loops
   Want to print 5 stars (*****):
   console.log("*");
   console.log("*");
   console.log("*");
   console.log("*");
   console.log("*");
   → Works, but what if you need 500 stars? 50,000 stars? NOT PRACTICAL!

   console.log always moves cursor to next line → prints one below the other

3. The 3 Main Loops in JavaScript

   A. for Loop → Use when you KNOW how many times to repeat
      Syntax:
      for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
          // body → code to repeat
      }

      Example: Print 1 to 10
      for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
          console.log("Star");
      }

      Flow:
      1. Initialization → let i = 1 (runs only once)
      2. Condition check → i <= 10 ?
      3. If true → body executes
      4. Increment → i++
      5. Repeat from step 2

   B. while Loop → Use when you DON’T know exact number of repetitions
      Syntax:
      initialization;
      while (condition) {
          // body
          increment/decrement;
      }

      Example:
      let i = 1;
      while (i <= 10) {
          console.log("Star");
          i++;
      }

      Read as: "As long as condition is true → keep doing this"

   C. do-while Loop → Runs body AT LEAST ONCE even if condition is false
      Syntax:
      initialization;
      do {
          // body (runs first)
          increment/decrement;
      } while (condition);

      Example:
      let i = 1;
      do {
          console.log("Star");
          i++;
      } while (i <= 10);

      Special: Body runs first → then checks condition

4. All Loops Have 4 Parts (Position may change)
   1. Initialization   → let i = 1
   2. Condition        → i <= 10
   3. Body             → console.log("Star")
   4. Increment/Decrement → i++

5. Practical Example – Print 10 Stars (One Below Other)
   // Using for loop
   for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
       console.log("*");
   }

   // Using while
   let i = 1;
   while (i <= 10) {
       console.log("*");
       i++;
   }

   // Using do-while
   let i = 1;
   do {
       console.log("*");
       i++;
   } while (i <= 10);

   Output:
   *
   *
   *
   ...
   (10 times)

6. Bonus Loops (Will Learn Later)
   - for...of → Clean way to loop over arrays
   - for...in → Used for objects

7. Golden Rules
   - Know number of repetitions → for loop
   - Don’t know exact count → while loop
   - Need at least one execution → do-while
   - Pattern programming = Test of loop mastery
   - Solve 200–250 loop questions → Your brain will automatically think in loops

8. Next Step → Pattern Programming
   Now we will print:
   *****
   *****
   *****
   *****
   (Square, Triangle, Pyramid, Diamond, etc.)

   This is where real loop power shows!
