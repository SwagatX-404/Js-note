CLASS 3 - IMPORTANT NOTES (JavaScript Series)
Topic: How JavaScript Executes – Compilation vs Interpretation + Script vs Interactive Mode

1. Quick Recap from Class 2
   - JavaScript is a High-Level Language (English-like statements).
   - Microprocessor understands ONLY Machine-Level (0s and 1s).
   - So High-Level code MUST be converted to Machine-Level before execution.

2. Two Ways to Convert High-Level → Machine-Level
   Way 1 → COMPILATION
   Way 2 → INTERPRETATION

3. COMPILATION (Used by C, C++, Java, etc.)
   - Software used          : COMPILER
   - How it works           : Takes the ENTIRE program at once → converts ALL lines into Machine code in ONE SHOT.
   - After conversion       : Complete Machine code is ready → given to microprocessor.
   - Speed                  : VERY FAST (because all instructions are ready before execution starts).

4. INTERPRETATION (Used by JavaScript, Python, etc.)
   - Software used          : INTERPRETER
   - How it works           : Takes ONE instruction at a time → converts → executes → then takes next instruction.
   - Process                : Convert → Execute → Convert next → Execute next → Repeat.
   - Speed                  : SLOWER than compilation (microprocessor has to wait after every line).

   IMPORTANT: JavaScript is an INTERPRETED language.

5. Comparison Table

   Feature                  | Compilation                     | Interpretation
   -------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------
   Software                 | Compiler                        | Interpreter
   Conversion               | Entire program at once          | One line at a time
   Execution speed          | Faster                          | Slower
   Examples                 | C, C++, Java, Go                | JavaScript, Python, Ruby

6. Because JavaScript is Interpreted → We get 2 Modes of Execution

   Mode 1: SCRIPT MODE (Most Common – 99% of real work)
      - You write JavaScript code inside a file → filename.js
      - Example: example.js
      - You run the complete file using command:
        node example.js
      - Interpreter reads the whole file, converts + executes line by line.

   Mode 2: INTERACTIVE MODE (REPL – Read Eval Print Loop)
      - Just type: node  (and press Enter)
      - You get a prompt >
      - You type one line → press Enter → immediate output
      - Then type next line → immediate output
      - Great for quick testing and learning.

7. Where Does JavaScript Actually Run?

   Inside Browser
      - Every browser has its own JavaScript Engine.
      - Chrome → V8 Engine
      - Firefox → SpiderMonkey
      - You can open Console (Right-click → Inspect → Console) and type JS directly.

   Outside Browser (on your computer)
      - Someone took Chrome’s V8 Engine → removed browser parts → modified it.
      - Result = Node.js
      - Install Node.js → you can run .js files anywhere using VS Code, terminal, etc.
      - Command: node filename.js

8. Practical Example (VS Code + Node.js)

   File: example.js
   console.log("Hello");
   console.log(2 + 2);
   console.log(2 * 2);

   Terminal command:
   node example.js
   → Output:
   Hello
   4
   4

   Interactive Mode:
   > node
   > console.log("Hello")
   Hello
   > 2 + 2
   4
   > 2 * 2
   4

9. Key Takeaways (Never Forget)

   - JavaScript = High-Level + Interpreted language
   - Uses Interpreter (not Compiler)
   - Converts & executes one line at a time
   - Can run in Browser (V8 inside Chrome) or Outside (Node.js)
   - Script Mode  → Write full code in .js file → run with node command
   - Interactive Mode → Type line by line → instant result (great for practice)

   In this course & real jobs → 99% we use SCRIPT MODE (.js files + Node.js or Browser)

Thank you! Namaste
