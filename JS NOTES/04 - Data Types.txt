CLASS NOTES - DATA TYPES (Java / JavaScript / Any Language)
Topic: What is a Data Type? – The Real Meaning (Most Important Class)

1. Computer Hardware Recap
   - 3 Main Components:
        1. Hard Disk (permanent storage)
        2. RAM (temporary storage during execution)
        3. Processor (the brain – executes everything)
   - When any software/program runs → all its data is stored in RAM
   - Processor uses RAM as its memory

2. What is RAM Really Made Of?
   - 2 GB RAM = 2 × 10⁹ bytes = 200 Crore bytes
   - 4 GB RAM = 400 Crore bytes
   - 16 GB RAM = 1600 Crore bytes
   → RAM is a huge collection of BYTES

   - 1 Byte = 8 Bits
   - 1 Bit = 2 Transistors (NPN + PNP)
   - Transistors can store only voltage → High (5V) = 1   or   Low (0V) = 0

   FINAL CONCLUSION:
   RAM can store ONLY 0s and 1s (binary) → Nothing else!

3. Real-World Data vs RAM – The Big Problem
   Real World Data Examples:
   - Age          → 23
   - Height       → 5.11
   - Name         → Rajkumar
   - Placed?      → Yes / No
   - Song         → Audio
   - Movie        → Video
   - Selfie       → Image

   None of these are in 0s and 1s!

   But RAM can store only 0s and 1s → MISMATCH!

4. The Solution → DATA TYPE
   Definition of Data Type (The Real Answer):
   A DATA TYPE is a CONVERTER
   → It takes real-world data (age, name, height, etc.)
   → Converts it into 0s and 1s (binary)
   → So that it can be stored in RAM

   Without Data Types → No program can store real-world data!

5. Types of Real-World Data (99.9% of data falls here)
   1. Whole numbers        → Integer     (age, no. of students)
   2. Decimal numbers      → Real/Float  (height, CGPA, weight)
   3. Single character     → Character   (A, z, @)
   4. Text / Name          → String      (Rajkumar, "Hello World")
   5. Yes or No            → Boolean     (true / false)
   6. Sound                → Audio
   7. Moving picture       → Video
   8. Still picture        → Image

6. In Programming Languages
   - For 1–5 → We have built-in DATA TYPES
   - For 6–8 (Audio, Video, Image) → We use LIBRARIES (pre-written code by others)

7. Java has 8 Primitive Data Types (We will learn all)
   Integer types:
   - byte   → 1 byte
   - short  → 2 bytes
   - int    → 4 bytes (most used)
   - long   → 8 bytes

   Real number types:
   - float  → 4 bytes
   - double → 8 bytes (most used)

   Character type:
   - char   → 2 bytes (for single character 'A', 'z', etc.)

   Boolean type:
   - boolean → true or false

   Note: String is NOT a primitive data type in Java → It is an Object (we will learn later)

8. JavaScript Data Types (for reference)
   - number  → for both integer and decimal (8 bytes internally)
   - string  → for text
   - boolean → true / false
   - undefined, null, bigint, symbol (advanced)
   JavaScript is dynamically typed → no need to write data type

9. Most Important Points to Remember Forever
   - RAM = Crores of bytes → bytes = 8 bits → bits = transistors → only 0s and 1s
   - Real-world data is NOT in 0s and 1s
   - Data Type = Converter (Real world data → Binary)
   - Without data types → impossible to store age, name, marks, etc. in computer
   - Every programming language has data types (Java → 8 primitive, JS → flexible)

   DATA TYPE = BRIDGE BETWEEN REAL WORLD AND COMPUTER
