📘 JavaScript Course – Class 1 Notes (Introduction to JavaScript)
1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that runs inside the browser and is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.

HTML → structure

CSS → styling

JavaScript → interactivity + dynamic changes

👉 Without learning JavaScript, web development is impossible.

2. Prerequisite

Before learning JavaScript, you MUST know:

HTML

CSS

Without these, JavaScript will not make sense.

3. What is a Web Application?

A web application is a system where:

The client (your computer + browser)

Sends a request to a server

Server sends response = HTML + CSS files

Browser renders (displays) these files

The browser’s primary job = Render HTML & CSS
(“Rendering” means showing UI on the screen.)

4. How Websites Work (Swiggy Example)
Steps:

You type swiggy.com in browser

Browser (client) sends a request

Server prepares HTML + CSS

Server sends response

Browser renders it on screen

You see the UI

You can inspect the HTML/CSS using Right Click → Inspect → Elements.

5. The Problem With Only HTML & CSS → They Are Static

HTML & CSS cannot change themselves.

They are static, meaning they don’t update automatically.

Example:

On Swiggy:

Clicking Add changes button to 1

Clicking + increases number

Clicking - decreases number

This change is happening without refreshing the page and without sending a new request to the server.

So who is changing the HTML & CSS?

👉 JavaScript.

6. Why Do We Need JavaScript? (Main Purpose)

JavaScript can:

✔ Access HTML
✔ Access CSS
✔ Dynamically modify them in the browser
✔ Add interactivity
✔ Make website fast and smooth

Earlier:

Every small action required a server request → slow websites
Now:

JavaScript changes things instantly inside the browser → fast UX

This is why JavaScript was invented.

7. Who Invented JavaScript?

Invented by Brendan Eich

While working at Netscape Navigator

Created in the 1990s

Old websites were slow, with no interaction — JS solved that.

Today:

JavaScript is everywhere → frontend, backend, mobile apps, desktop apps, IoT, AI, etc.

8. How JavaScript Runs in a Browser

Every browser has a JavaScript Engine.

Browser	JavaScript Engine
Chrome	V8
Firefox	SpiderMonkey
Safari	JavaScriptCore / Nitro

These engines read JS code and execute it.

👉 Only JavaScript is allowed to run natively inside the browser.

9. Executing JavaScript in the Browser

Easiest method: Browser Console

Steps:

Open browser

Right-click → Inspect

Go to Console tab

Type JavaScript commands:

Examples:

console.log("Hello World");
2 + 2;
5 * 10;


This shows how the browser executes JavaScript instantly.

10. Summary of Class 1
Why JavaScript?

To make web pages dynamic & interactive

To modify HTML/CSS without reloading

To make websites fast

What JavaScript Does

Runs inside browser

Uses browser’s JS engine

Changes UI instantly (DOM manipulation)

Prerequisites

HTML + CSS

Understanding of browser and server interaction

⭐ Final Takeaway

JavaScript = Language of the Web
You cannot build modern web applications without it.

Syntax

Variables

Functions

Loops

DOM

Events
